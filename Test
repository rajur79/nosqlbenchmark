It was way back in 2007, I used to work in UK. I wanted to visit India, and all my friends started planning for outing. I arrived in India and my friends spoke up over phone and decided we will go for a short trek the next day. As always happens, some were busy and some started giving excuses. I know these guys since school dayz...they were always the same!! So finally at 3 PM we all decided we go somewhere, but not sure where we are going. Then I planned, we will go to Hogenakkal falls which is around 200 plus KM from Bangalore. It was rainy season and looked lot green outside. This falls is where the Aishwaraya's movie Ravan was made. 

We 4 met up at a common place in bikes, and started planning. Being a bachelor in UK, I had learnt cooking and Biriyani was one thing I had mastered to some extent. So these guys wanted me to prepare Biriyani on the way and we could have it and then proceed towards the falls. We bought a country chicken on the way (in some house), my friend bought vessels, kerosene, spices, firewood all from home and we moved on. I made it clear to my friends, I can only do the cooking, but I cant cut the chicken. We have a specialist in the team, so its his job. We left by around 4 from Bangalore and took the Bangalore-Tamil Nadu express highway. As we crossed Bangalore border in the evening, it started raining like dogs and cats. We realized that there was a cyclone in Chennai and these rains are due to it. So had to stop midway at various places and already it was getting dark.   

We decided to halt somewhere so that the rain will slow down. It was around 8:30 at night and we found one deserted bus stop on a remote and lonely highway. So we decided we won't get any better place than that, to put up fire. Already we were completely drenched in rain and hungry too. We relaxed there for sometime and the guys started making arrangements for cooking. Just then we realized we dont have enough water to prepare biriyani and also to drink. But it's so dark out there and we could see nothing. To our hope we could just see one small light far away. I asked two of my friends to wait there and cut the chicken and make arrangements, by that time I can go with my other friend and get some water. 

It was a small hut kind of a house with a roof sheet put in front of the house to protect from rain. They were having a fire place in front of the house. There was one poor tamil lady with a child sitting in front of the house and was cooking something. We gave her the vessel and asked for water, she asked us why we need it. My friend advised me not to tell them our plan, but i disclosed. She made an offer - "If you cook here, we will give you firewood and vessels. Moreover we don't get to eat such things. So you could give us also, and you have a shelter here". I felt it was not a bad idea, so I asked my other friend to go and get the other two guys. He went to the bus stop and got the two guys. The lady was kind enough and offered me all that was required for the preparation, and there you go.... yummy tasty biriyani was ready. We all started having it and asked the lady and her people to help themselves. There was one old drunkard who kept talking to himself and there were one or two more.

We had the biriyani and left the remaining in the vessels and left it on the fire place so that it remains hot. While we were having biriyani, the lady asked me out of the 4, how many are married. It looked silly.. I said none of us. She pointed at one of my friend and asked, is he not married too!! Hehe, he appears so, but he was not.. so we started pulling his leg. The lady said, you all stay here tonight and leave early morning. The falls is still 70 KM away and the rain has not stopped. I grew suspicious thinking they want to rob us or attack us in the night for cash. She kept insisting, don't worry we will sleep inside and give you mat and blanket for you to sleep. But stay here tonight and leave early morning. I was not convinced but my friends asked me to accept. I suggested them that not all will sleep, one will be awake to ensure nothing goes wrong. They agreed, we got a torn mat and two blanket with dozens of holes. It was already 11:30 past and we were just laughing and talking to each other. The place was damn silent and dark, this was the only house for atleast miles away. It was around 15-20 minutes walk from the highway. 

In the total silence and darkness, I heard some lady hummming very far away. Then slowly it sounded like some lady was singing. But the voice was kind of echoing far away, so we started wondering.. who is it and why at that night she is singing and what is happening. In a few minutes, we started hearing the sound of anklets ..the sound that we couldn't realize from where it is coming. But we know its not anything closer. Now each of us started to think ten different things. But it was almost getting clear to me, something wrong. Now the singing stopped and a hugeee screaming lady voice was heard. This time, we all just got shaken and didn't know what to do. We had no guts to get up and go and see what is happening. Just held each other's hands and covered up the blankets. The blanket with the holes, could give us a view atleast. Then for a minute or so it stopped, then again started the screaming and crying of the lady. It just was one voice I cannot forget. Then the voice started getting more and more closer as if like coming towards us. Imagine we have the chicken biriyani right in front of us, and we know that evils like it. So with no idea whats going to happen, we just lied down and peeping from the blanket hole. 

The scene that we saw in front of our eyes, can only be experienced and not explained!! There were two guys with two lighted kerosene sticks (the ones they use in villages during marriages and all) burning bright and running just in front of us. It was hardly a few feet away from us. As they kept runnning and chasing, the voice kept getting louder and louder. It was so clear in the bright light.... there was no lady that we could see. But just the voice and the 2 men chasing that voice. It was one shock of my life time, but still we don't even know what is in store for us. I started making up my mind to be prepared for the worse. Luckily the voice kept going towards the highway. After the men chased and ran for around 5 minutes, we slowly got up and looked further to see where they go. The light could be seen for sometime and they were returning back. We quickly came and lied down, as we don't know if the voice is again coming back. The two guys just came casually talking and went back to where they came from. Don't even remember when I slept and how..then it was morning 6 am. 

We got up and waited for thanking the people to provide us the place. The lady came and offered us tea. While having tea, she asked if we had sound sleep. My friends all agreed, but I could not resist and asked her. She asked me in return.. "Y did I ask you guys, who all are married? The place is highly haunted and there are almost no one living around. So all the neighboring village people, they come here to this village to get a solution. This place is called Kaveripattinam and it's famous for treating the possessed. The spirits are let go, but they are supposed to stay away from village. It usually remains in the deserted bus stop, but at times it gets into the village. The 2 guys who chased it, ensured that it won't come inside. It just returned back to its bus stop place. On the bus stop wall it is written - Heavy accident area and also published how many deaths happen. Here people keep dying in this highway almost daily and the government says that its due to a sharp u turn bend. But the real fact, only we know. The lady ghosts keep hunting for unmarried virgin boys, and takes their lives". 

I asked how come they live without fear. Just then she pointed me at the trishul and the murugan statue in front of the house. The house was put into a protection, and nothing can enter there. So thats the reason she asked us to stay, and she had protected us. God!!! no words left. Said a big thanks to her and also told her that she has saved our lives. We proceeded to hogenakkal to celebrate the life after death :-)
